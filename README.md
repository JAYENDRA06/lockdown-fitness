# lockdown-fitness
Since the pandemic has affected not only our mental but also our physical health, we have made a website called 'Lockdown Fitness' 
to enable users to maintain their health and physique even while at home. Our website has a Body Mass Index (BMI) calculator which displays the 
BMI on entering the height and weight of a person. Depending on the outcome, you can choose to navigate to one of three links. 
There you can find tips and advice on the exercises that can be done and diet plans for a healthy daily regime. 
To enable a better sense of community, we are planning to feature 10 real stories on our website, sent by real people by tagging #lockyourfitness 
on our instagram handles. This will not only help us find out on what works for people and what does not but also create excitement among users to participate 
and know they are not alone.
